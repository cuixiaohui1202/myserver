# myserver
Ethereum web3 node.js server

1. You first need a running Ethereum node on your computer.  
For this you should install geth and run it with rpc enabled.
Two shell scripts do this: start_geth.sh and mine.sh. 
Mine.sh will mine on the test network.
You also need to have at least one valid account on your machine (use Ethereum wallet or Mist).  Begin mining on the testnet so that you have some Ether to play with.

2.  Run the test suite:

$ npm test

3. Start myserver:

$ npm start
